The 'user' is the first code specified in the permissions section of a file.
This is done with the 'chmod' command. You then specifiy which user (or users) you 
are changing the permissions for. In the case of chaning is for the user, the flag is u.
You can do this in two different formats. 

The first is in this format; 

chmod u=rwx,g=r,o-rwx file2.

Where r=read, w=write, x=execute.
= grant level
- remove level
+ add level

Alternatively, you can sum the octal values, where:
Read = 4
Write = 2
Execute = 1

An example of a file where the user can read, a group can write and others can read and execute would be
chmod 435 file3
