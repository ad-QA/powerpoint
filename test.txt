# Changing permissions for the Documnent / Folder owner i.e group


chmod permissions "filename"

Where,

permissions can be read, write, execute or a combination of them.
filename is the name of the file for which the permissions need to change. This parameter can also be a list if files to change permissions in bulk.

For Example, to give the group write permissions in this file (test.txt), you would do:

		chmod g+w test.txt


	where g = group
	where + = add permissions
	where w = write permission

Thank you

The 'user' is the first code specified in the permissions section of a file.
This is done with the 'chmod' command. You then specifiy which user (or users) you 
are changing the permissions for. In the case of chaning is for the user, the flag is u.
You can do this in two different formats. 

The first is in this format; 

chmod u=rwx,g=r,o-rwx file2.

Where r=read, w=write, x=execute.
= grant level
- remove level
+ add level

Alternatively, you can sum the octal values, where:
Read = 4
Write = 2
Execute = 1

An example of a file where the user can read, a group can write and others can read and execute would be
chmod 435 file3

"Others" refers to the group of users on a system who are not the owner of a file or mombers of a group.
This corresponds to the third set of permission when performing an "ls -l" command on a file.
To change the permissions for this group, one can do the command "sudo chmod o+*", where * can be x, w, r for execute, write or read permissions.
