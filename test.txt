"Others" refers to the group of users on a system who are not the owner of a file or mombers of a group.
This corresponds to the third set of permission when performing an "ls -l" command on a file.
To change the permissions for this group, one can do the command "sudo chmod o+*", where * can be x, w, r for execute, write or read permissions.
