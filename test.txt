# Changing permissions for the Documnent / Folder owner i.e group


chmod permissions "filename"

Where,

permissions can be read, write, execute or a combination of them.
filename is the name of the file for which the permissions need to change. This parameter can also be a list if files to change permissions in bulk.

For Example, to give the group write permissions in this file (test.txt), you would do:

		chmod g+w test.txt


	where g = group
	where + = add permissions
	where w = write permission

Thank you
